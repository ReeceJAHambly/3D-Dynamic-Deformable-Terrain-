# 3D-Dynamic-Deformable-Terrain 
OpenGL
Honours Stage Project

Specification:
Collidable, Deformable Terrain.		
The goal of this project is to generate a large terrain that is represented in such a way that a series of geometric primitives are able to collide with it.
The terrain should also be deformable by certain events (such as explosions or collisions with large objects). This project should begin with a review of various methods of collision detection and response before selecting the method deemed most appropriate for the task. Care will have to be taken to ensure that the terrain is suitably represented by a dynamic collidable surface that maintains a high level of performance.

This is a technical project and should only be taken on by students who are confident in their understanding of the graphics pipeline and of collision detection methods.
